chef-setupdb Cookbook

Usage
-----
#### chef-setupdb::default
Add this cookbook, and run it in your regular run_list (I added after the other cookbooks in my vagrantfile).  You can then modify the sites/xxxxx.json files accordingly

```json
{
    "id": "<siteid>",
    "host": "<sitehostname>",
    "docroot": "<sitedocroot>",
    "aliases": [
        "<sitealiases>"
    ],
    "dbname": "<sitedbname>",
    "dbuser": "<sitedbuser>",
    "dbuserpass": "<sitedbpass>",
    "dbpath": "<sitedbpath>"
}
```
